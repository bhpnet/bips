## BHP Improvement Protocol

The BHP Improvement Protocol contains the set of fundamental governing principles for the BHP Network. It outlines the vision for BHP and the principles, processes, and parties involved in making decisions that affect the future of the network. It also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.

## BHP Design Principles

The design of BHP is intended to follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.

## BHP Improvement Principles

When making decisions about how to improve BHP, we will follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.

## Making changes to the BHP network

BHP Improvement Proposals (BIPs)Â are the primary mechanism by which the BHP community can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the BHP network. These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

## A decentralized, global network

BHP is still in its infancy.  To help the network grow and evolve, it is critical for the community to collectively be engaged in proposing, discussing, and implementing changes that improve the network and its operations.
This improvement protocol helps achieve that objective for all members of the BHP community (developers, validators, clients, token holders, ecosystem partners, and more).
